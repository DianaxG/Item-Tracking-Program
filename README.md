# Item-Tracking-Program
The project involves building a program for a grocery store, the Corner Grocer, to track the frequency of items purchased throughout the day. It allows users to input a specific item and receive its frequency, print a list of all items with their frequencies, or display a histogram of item frequencies. The program utilizes a std::map to efficiently store and manage the item-frequency pairs.

The project addresses the need for the Corner Grocer to analyze item purchases to optimize their layout. By providing frequency information and histograms, the program helps the store identify popular items and arrange them effectively.

One strength of the code is its modularity and readability. Each functionality is encapsulated within methods of the ItemTracker class, making the code easy to understand and maintain. Additionally, the use of a std::map ensures efficient lookup and storage of item frequencies.

While the current implementation is functional, enhancements could include error handling for invalid user input and optimization of file input/output operations. Error handling would improve the robustness of the program, while optimizing file operations could enhance efficiency, especially for large datasets.

One challenging aspect of the project might be designing an efficient and user-friendly menu system. This was addressed by organizing the menu options logically and providing clear prompts for user input.

For support and resources, I utilized documentation for C++ standard library containers and consulted online forums for best practices in C++ programming.

Skills gained from this project, such as working with containers like std::map, handling file input/output, and designing user interfaces, are transferable to other programming projects. Additionally, the practice of encapsulating functionality within classes and using modular design principles will be valuable for me when working on future coursework and projects.

To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I followed best practices such as meaningful variable naming, clear commenting, and modular design. The use of a class-based approach encapsulates related functionality, making it easier to modify and separate from the rest of the code, it made it organized and easy to read/follow; Adhering to coding standards and consistent formatting enhances readability and maintainability.
